    <h3 id="about"> About Me</h3>
    <p class="aboutme">Well, life has been quite a ride for me. And to cope from reality, I do weird things; like coding, gaming, working out, listening to music, and watching movies. These hobbies are my escape, my way of finding joy in the little things. They help me navigate through the ups and downs, providing a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Each hobby has its own charm, offering a unique way to unwind and recharge. Whether it's getting lost in a game, lifting weights at the gym, or immersing myself in a good movie, these activities bring balance to my life.</p>
