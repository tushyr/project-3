# My Favorite Things - CSS Practice Project

## Project Overview

This project is a simple HTML and CSS webpage titled **"My Favorite Things"**. It was built as part of The Odin Project's "Intro to CSS" section to practice foundational concepts in web development.

The primary objective of this project was to apply the CSS concepts Iâ€™ve learned so far, including selectors, styling methods, and text formatting, while creating a visually structured and styled web page.

## Skills Demonstrated

* HTML structure (headings, paragraphs, lists, images, buttons)
* External CSS linking and organization
* Using Class and ID selectors appropriately
* Grouping selectors to reduce repetition
* Chaining selectors for targeted styling
* Descendant combinators for styling nested elements
* Text styling (color, font size, font family, text alignment, font weight)
* Image sizing using height and width properties
* Working with inline, internal, and external CSS methods

## Page Features

* A main heading styled with CSS
* Three distinct sections:

  * Favorite Movies (with an image and styled text)
  * Favorite Songs (styled differently with its own image)
  * Hobbies (with unique background and image)
* A styled button element
* A simple footer note

## What I Learned

This project helped me reinforce key CSS concepts such as selector types, text formatting, layout structuring, and external stylesheet linking. I gained hands-on experience in organizing HTML content and applying different CSS techniques for design and layout.

## Next Steps

I will continue with the next sections of The Odin Project, focusing on the CSS Box Model, positioning techniques, and more advanced styling concepts.
